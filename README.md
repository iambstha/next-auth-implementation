## For Stable App Router
![Homepage Shot](./public/screenshots/1.jpg)

## How to?

### For live demo visit [NEXT AUTH HOMEPAGE](https://next-auth-implementation-phi.vercel.app//) deployed in Vercel

### For local hosting
1. Visit my repository at github [here](https://github.com/iambstha/next-auth-implementation)
2. Clone the repository in your local drive
3. Open command prompt & navigate to the project directory
4. Create `.env` file
5. Paste everything from `env.txt` in `.env` file. Make sure to replace the required values.
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. If any issue with tailwind or any node modules occur, please `npm install` in your command prompt
6. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser; chrome or brave is preferred, since there is webkit audio controller in the application, not every browser supports the controller.
